# Oxford oath text

## Motto

Ostendat ex bona conversatione operationem suam in mansuetudine sapientiae. (James 3:13)

*Show by good conduct that your works come from the humility of wisdom.*

## Preamble

Believing in the sanctity of every human person, and that technology ought to serve us and contribute to the common good;

Conscious that our creativity is both a gift and a responsibility, and that the tools we form in turn form us;

Recognising that the work I do requires the exercise of judgement not just in the technical choices I make but also in the way I act while after I made them and speak about them and the certainty I evince. 

Fearful of the unintended consquences on the welfare and dignity of individual humans and humanity as a whole;

Lamenting the ways such unintended consequences of choices made has already resulted in outcomes which many experience in as the displacement human connection, degradation of the dignity of work, and contributing to the erosive footprint technology has always left upon the natural world;

And yet, rejoicing in the potential of AI to aid understanding, improve wellbeing, expand opportunity, and empower humanity in our shared vocation to seek the true, the good, and the beautiful;

## Commitments

In the presence of:

- (OPTION 1) God
- (OR OPTION 2) what I hold most sacred

and these witnesses, I make these commitments:

### Orientation

I will approach my work with humility, mindful of my limitations and the consequences of my actions and uncertainty of my predictions.

I will honour the sanctity of humanity, and be hesitant in elevating my work to divine status..

I will undertake my work with joy and caution at the wonder and weight of what we are making.

### Vision

I will empower human agency.

I will align my work with virtuous human motivations and worthy objects of attention.

I will develop my work to support the social fabric of humanity and safeguard the the natural world.

### Responsibility

I will embed honesty in my work about the nature, imperfections, and limits of AI systems.

I will strive to make my work an instrument of peace.

I will guard against illusions that erode understanding of reality, harmful asymmetries of power, and the devaluation of good and creative forms of human work.

## Conclusion

I will uphold the integrity of this oath, and when faced with a conflict between these commitments and the demands of my profession, I will give voice to my conscience and act as I am able.

(OPTIONAL: May God who has given me the will to profess these commitments grant me also the grace to perform them.)
